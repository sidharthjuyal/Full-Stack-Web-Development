    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
    Definition: CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and design of a web page written in HTML.
    It controls layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects..

    Key Points:

    Selectors and Properties: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles through properties. For
    example, h1 { color: blue; } targets h1 elements and changes their color to blue.
        Box Model: The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements, including margins, borders,
        padding, and content.
        Responsive Design: CSS includes techniques like media queries to create responsive designs that adapt to
        different screen sizes.
