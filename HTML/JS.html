    JavaScript
    Definition: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used to create interactive and dynamic elements
    on web pages. It enables client-side scripting, which allows for the manipulation of HTML and CSS and handling user
    events.
.
    Key Points:

    Variables and Functions: JavaScript uses variables to store data and functions to perform tasks and operations. For
    example, let x = 5; and function greet() { alert('Hello!'); }.
    DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with and modify the Document Object Model (DOM) to change HTML content and
    styles dynamically.
    Event Handling: JavaScript handles events such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard input to create interactive
    web experiences.
